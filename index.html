          <h2> What is Meditation ?</h2>
          <p>
            Meditation is a practice that involves focusing or clearing your mind using a combination of mental and physical techniques.
            Depending on the type of meditation you choose, you can meditate to relax, reduce anxiety and stress, and more.
          </p>

          <h2>Benefits of Meditation</h2>

          <div>
            <p id="meditation-benefit">
                Another study of 1,300 people showed that meditation can reduce stress. 
                The effects were noticeably stronger in those individuals with the highest stress levels. 
                Research has gone on to show that those symptoms of stress-related conditions can also be reduced with meditation.
