    <h2> What is Meditation ?</h2>
    <p>
      Meditation is a practice that involves focusing or clearing your mind using a combination of mental and physical
      techniques.
      Depending on the type of meditation you choose, you can meditate to relax, reduce anxiety and stress, and more.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of Meditation</h2>

    <div>
      <p id="meditation-benefit">
        Another study of 1,300 people showed that meditation can reduce stress.
        The effects were noticeably stronger in those individuals with the highest stress levels.
        Research has gone on to show that those symptoms of stress-related conditions can also be reduced with
        meditation.

  <div class="meditation-types">

    <h2> 1. Walking meditation</h2>
    <p>Walking meditation is a form of mindfulness meditation practiced all over the world.
      At its core, walking meditation is simply bringing your attention to your feet,
      your body and the ground below you and focusing your mind on what it feels like to walk</p>

    <h2> 2. Guided Meditation</h2>
    <p>Guided meditation describes a type of meditation led by a teacher,
      in person or via audio or video. When starting out,
      having an expert lead you through the basic steps of your meditation practice is recommended.</p>

    <h2> 3. Mindfulness</h2>
    <p>Mindfulness is a type of meditation in which you focus on being intensely aware of what you're sensing and
      feeling in the moment,
      without interpretation or judgment. Practicing mindfulness involves breathing methods, guided imagery,
      and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress</p>

    <h2> 4. Spiritual meditation</h2>
    <p>Spiritual meditation is an experience that takes you to the depths of who you are.
      You, as your real self, stripped of all the perceptions you had about yourself until that point in your life.
      In the process, you experience joy and peace. A feeling of love and light warms up your being.</p>

    <h2> 5. Movement meditation</h2>
    <p>As you walk, breath deeply and allow your shoulders to relax downward.
      If you sense any muscle tension take a few deep breaths as you walk.
      Focus on sensing that the air you breath is helping your muscles to relax.</p>

    <h2> 6.Visualization meditation</h2>
    <p>Visualization meditation is a type of meditation where you create a mental image or scenario in your mind in
      order to take you out of your busy day to day,
      and bring you to a place of inner peace. The goal is to make the visualization as vivid as possible, engaging all
      your senses.</p>

    <h2> 7. Transcendental Meditation</h2>
    <p>The Transcendental Meditation program is a type of meditation.
      You silently repeat a word or phrase in your mind to settle yourself into deep consciousness.
      The Transcendental Meditation technique has been found to have many health benefits, including lowering your blood
      pressure and reducing stress.</p>
