          <h2> 1. Walking meditation</h2>
            <p>Walking meditation is a form of mindfulness meditation practiced all over the world. 
               At its core, walking meditation is simply bringing your attention to your feet, 
               your body and the ground below you and focusing your mind on what it feels like to walk</p>
          
          <h2> 2. Guided Meditation</h2>
              <p>Guided meditation describes a type of meditation led by a teacher, 
                in person or via audio or video. When starting out, 
                having an expert lead you through the basic steps of your meditation practice is recommended.</p>
          
          <h2> 3. Mindfulness</h2>
            <p>Mindfulness is a type of meditation in which you focus on being intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling in the moment,
                 without interpretation or judgment. Practicing mindfulness involves breathing methods, guided imagery, 
                 and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress</p>
          
          <h2> 4. Spiritual meditation</h2>
              <p>Spiritual meditation is an experience that takes you to the depths of who you are.
                 You, as your real self, stripped of all the perceptions you had about yourself until that point in your life. 
                 In the process, you experience joy and peace. A feeling of love and light warms up your being.</p>
