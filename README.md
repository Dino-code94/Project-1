# Meditation

- What is meditation? 
  Meditation is a practice that involves focusing or clearing your mind using a combination of mental and physical techniques. 
  Depending on the type of meditation you choose, you can meditate to relax, reduce anxiety and stress, and more.

- Focusing your attention is one of the most important elements of meditation. 
  Focusing your attention is what helps free your mind from the many things that cause stress and 
  worry. You can focus your attention on things such as a certain object, an image, a mantra or even your breathing. Relaxed breathing.
